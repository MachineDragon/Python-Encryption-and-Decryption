# Python-Encryption-and-Decryption


This fun little project takes in a string as a user input

It then iterates throughout each letter in the string

It then encrypts the string by moving each letter by 5 characters in the alphabet-number string

                   Encryption
ex.) Test Word  ---------------->    Yjxye1twi


The end user who has the decryption code inputs the coded message and it outputs it by reverseing the 5 character move

                   Decryption
ex.) Yjxye1twi ----------------->   Test Word
